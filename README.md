# WORTHY WOODSMITHS WILL WIN OUT: MAYOR MANDATES COTTAGE INDUSTRY

**Reported by `Official Mayor-Endorsed News`**

How many tables could a woodsmith smith if a woodsmith could smith tables? What about tables? Bookshelves? Citizens of `term-world` are about to find out. The Office of the Mayor announced--effective today--that all denizes of the great digital community should gear up to, as the Mayor yelled with increasing intensity, "make....Make....MAKE! For me, of course, your Mayor."

While recent weeks have seen some unrest among the ungrateful residents of various neighborhoods--namely about NECESSARY mayoral data collection efforts--the Office of the Mayor hopes that industrious mandates to innovate might distract everyone enough that they forget about it. Which, you should. As the Mayor noted in a press conference held only for the benefit of O.M.E.N.: "[they] _should_."

So start up those saw blades, prepare to sell a majority stake in your soul, and learn some lumber skills; `term-world`, the Mayor noted, is about to "get all L.L. Bean up in here."

## Learning Outcomes

In this assignment you will learn:

* how to import custom modules and use them as `object`s
* how to create `class`es and `object`s to achieve purpose-built tasks
* observe and reflect on `object` behaviors

You will also continue to practice:

- Using data structures such as lists
- Writing Python functions
- Writing Python code that uses control structures (`while` loops and `if` statements)
- Running Python programs
- Debugging Python programs
- Technical writing in Markdown
- Command line navigation
- Using version control (Git)

These assignment learning outcomes contribute to the following course learning outcomes described in the [course syllabus](https://github.com/cmpsc100-allegheny-college/course_information):

1. Apply Python programming principles to execute and explain computer code that implements interactive, novel solutions to a variety of computable problems.
2. Release code consistent with industry-standard practices using professional grade IDEs, command line tools, and version control tools.
3. Analyze and suggest revisions to existing Python language code to improve or add functionality.

## Tasks Overview

To achieve the learning objectives of the assignment, we need to:

* use our `main.py` program to coordinate the creation of:
  * `Lumber`
  * various `object`s such as `Chair`s, `Table`s, and `Bookshelf`s
* leverage `module`s built to modify, change, and interact with others by
  * using the `Saw` and
  * `Woodpile`
* `import` necessary `module`s into `main` and use their "powers" (`method`s)

The more quantitative steps:

* create and cut `Lumber` enough to create `55` board feet (bf) to:
  * use `25` for a `Table`
  * use `20` for a `Bookshelf`
  * use `10` for a `Chair`
* add cut `Lumber` to the `Woodpile`
* pull from the `Woodpile` to build the items list above

If all of this is done correctly, you should see a `Chair.py`, `Table.py` and `Bookshelf.py` in your `products` directory.

## Completing `woodshop` content

For this activity, you'll need to complete the following steps for all of your `woodshop` items, creating a (somewhat) autonomous factory.

For `Saw.py`, `BookshelfPlans.py`, `ChairPlans.py`, and `TablePlans.py`, you do not need to do anything. For convenience, though:

|Plan |Required `Lumber` |
|:----|:-----------------|
|Chair| 10|
|Table| 25|
|Bookshelf| 20|
|**Total**    |**55** |

### Plans

You do not need to read the code for each plan unless interested. _However_, you should know that each has the following profile:

* they take `1` argument/parameter: a `list` of pieces from the `WoodPile`

If there's enough `Lumber` in the `WoodPile` to build an item, it builds in the `products` directory.

### `Saw.py`

However, you _do_ need to understand how `Saw.py` works. Take a moment to review the file and make comments in it (these are part of the grader).

|`method`|Parameters|Description|`return`|
|:-------|:---------|:------|:-----------|
|`__init__`|`cut_size` (`int`)|Number of pieces to cut from a `Lumber`|`None`|
|`cut`|`lumber` (`Lumber`)|`Lumber` object to cut into pieces|`list`|

### `Lumber.py`

To make anything out of wood, we need `Lumber`. Thankfully, now we can make some. In `term-world`, `Lumber` is very simple to create. All it takes is:

* a `constructor` which takes `1` _explicit_ parameter for the length of the board to create
* sets the parameter as the `length` of the individual `object` board
  * this one is only a _bit_ tricky; think of what `Lumber` knows about itself

|`method`|Parameters|Description|`return`|
|:-------|:---------|:------|:-----------|
|`__init__`|`length` (`int`)|Sets the `length` property of a given board|`None`|

### Woodpile.py

Once we've cut some `Lumber`, we need a place to store it. This is where our `WoodPile` comes in. The requirements here are a bit different:

* a `constructor` (no parameters) which makes an empty `list` called `pieces` which we'll add stuff to once we've cut wood
* a `method` (i.e. `function`) called `add` which:
  * keeps in mind that there's a `list` called `pieces`
  * takes `1` _explicit_ parameter which is a `list` of chopped pieces of wood
  * adds these to `pieces`

One clever thing to note about what `list`s do here--let's look at an example:

```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3]
new_numbers = [4, 5, 6]

# Use the increment assignment operator
numbers += new_numbers

# What happens?
print(numbers)
```

Another issue to remind yourself of: `pieces` contains a `list` of `Lumber`-type `objects`. How does that change how we handle it?

|`method`|Parameters|Description|`return`|
|:-------|:---------|:------|:-----------|
|`__init__`|`None`|Creates an empty `list` called `pieces` to add to over time |`None`|
|`add`|`lumber` (`list`)|`Lumber` objects to cut into pieces|`None`|

### `main.py`

This is the coordinating center of all of our work. Here, we use the `Woodpile`, `Saw`, various `Plan`s and `Lumber` to make our objects. We need as much `Lumber` board-feed (bf) as all `3` objects require. Here, we use all the various `method`s 

This means, we must `import`:

* `Woodpile`
* `Saw`
* `Lumber`
* `Bookshelf`
* `Chair`
* `Table`

Here, you will create as much `Lumber` as needed, cutting each `Lumber` with `Saw` and then adding those cut pieces to `WoodPile`. Once you have enough pieces, you use plans for each item of furniture to build that item. If furniture is built correctly, it will be placed into the `products` folder. See `TODO` instructions in `main.py` for more detailed steps to follow.

### `reflection.md`

Don't forget to finish the `reflection.md` file in the `clean-up` folder!

## Improvement suggestions

Here are some suggestions for improvements you can, **but are not limited to** use:

|Improvement Suggestions |Description        |
|:-----------------------|:------------------|
|Methods                 |Make a given furniture product useful (i.e. give it functionality) |
|Methods                 |Make the saw more efficient by adding blades |
|Objects                 |Make and build a new product plan in the `plans` folder |
|Objects                 |Make a new cuttable material (i.e. stone?)†   |
|Objects/Methods         |Completely automate the manufacturing process†† |
|Conditional statments   |Give user a choice of which product(s) they would like to make (i.e. a menu)††† |
|Iteration/Data structures|Display number of boards made and total length of each as part of manufacturing process |
|Objects/Iteration/Data structures | If deficient some amount of board feet, report how many and which products build or fail |
|Objects                 |Add functionality to the woodpile to print how much wood has been added |


`†` If possible, also make a way to, for example, _quarry_ stone?

`††` Here, you shouldn't need to know how many board feet are required; the plans _tell_ you

`†††` The menu must also _work_ (i.e. if an object is chosen, the factory should go to work)

**Make sure to link your issue with the pull request you used to make your actually improvement.**

**If you are not following an improvement suggestion you need to have your improvement suggestion checked by the professor before proceeding.**

## Evaluating `hall of records` Content

This is an individual assignment and each neighbor should submit their own completed assignment. Code should not look similar among any class members. As described in the [course contract](https://github.com/cmpsc100-allegheny-college/course_information/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) members should not  share code and working solutions but instead should feel welcome to share tips and tricks, help each other in understanding core concepts, and plan, sketch, or otherwise draft general approaches.

To receive a `Complete` status on this assignment, the assignment repository on GitHub must have a green check before the deadline. There are no additional requirements for this assignment.

The content for this week is outfitted with a grader program that can be used to evaluate the completion status for the week. To run the grader for this week's work, you will need to be in the topmost level of the assignment folder. Once there, run the command:

`gatorgrade`

The grader will take a few minutes to do its work, but once it's complete the program will populate your terminal window with a series of checks that gauge the overall "completeness" of some of your required work.

## Backup Policy Reminder

**While we may use this server to store code, you are responsible for using GitHub as your main backup.**

In the event that the `term-world` server goes down for any unforeseen reason, your work may be lost. Though this server is backed up on a regular (i.e. weekly) basis, there is no guarantee that up-to-the-minute data for your work will be restored.

Remember: to err is human; to back up your work is *divine*.
